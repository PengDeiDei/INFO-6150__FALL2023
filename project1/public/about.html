                    <p> 
                        Me and my siblings were first found stray near the city of Zillah. We were rescued and sent to Yakima 
                        Humane for care and treatment. Due to the lack of available space, we were transferred to Seattle 
                        Humane two months later. However, during the long transportation without enough caring,  we were 
                        unfortunately affected by FeLV while we were weak and slim with merely 2 lbs. 
                        Fortunately, as we arrived at Seattle Huame, we were immediately adopted by several kind families.

                    <h3> Me after being adopted:</h3>
                    <p> 
                        After being adopted from Seattle Humane, my family fed me as much and diverse as they could. I 
                        could receive 5 meals a day from 6 in the morning to 12 at night, including goat milk, egg yolk, 
                        cat canned food, dry cat food, and other supplements.Besides, my parents were keen on inviting 
                        friends to visit me and take me to explore the outdoors.Though I still don't get along 
                        too easily with other cats, I've grown into a brave cat who is close to people.
